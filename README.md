# From Recognition to Cognition: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (cvpr 2019 oral)

This repository is from data and PyTorch code for the paper [From Recognition to Cognition: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (arxiv)](https://visualcommonsense.com). I've applied my own model for performance improvement(hope so... :) )

Detailed model architecture will be described in models
